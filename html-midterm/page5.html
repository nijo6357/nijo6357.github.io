        <h2>Change Log</h2>
        <h4>Page 1 Changes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>The Table row element on line 38 had no closing tag. I added one.</li>
            <li>The Table element on line 32 had no closing tag. I added one.</li>
            <li>The head for the page was incomplete. No Language was set for the page. I set the language to English and character set to UTF-8</li>
            <li>There was no closing tag on item 3 in the list on page one. I added one. </li>
            <li>Line 35 did not have a p tag at the end of the statement "contains a nested paragraph." I added one.</li>
            <li>The data cell on line 41 did not have a closing tag. I added one.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Page 2 Changes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>The paragraph starting on line 27 had an accidental tag, which was deleted. The paragraph was bolded except the first word and it did not have a closing tag, which created numerous errors thoughout the code since the computer thought we were trying to bold everything underneath. I moved the opening bold tag to the beginning of the paragraph and added a closing tag afterwords.</li>
            <li>The paragraph starting on line 27's "p" tag was not at the end of the paragraph. I moved it to the right location. </li>
            <li>Line 53 had a bold tag around an H2 tag, which is not allowed in html since headers are already bold.</li>
            <li>Line 57 had an incorrect anchor element, which had no link to a wikepedia page. I properly anchored a wikepedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_arch">segmental arches</a></li>
            <li>The header (H6) on line 74 did not have a closing tag. I added one. This was also causing problems on lines 76, 84, 91, and 102 since we were telling the computer to put a p tag (and an H3) within a header tag. </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Page 3 Changes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>A Doc type was not established before coding began, the computer did not know which type of document it was. I specified it is an html doc.</li>
            <li>The document head was not correct, it was missing a title, meta, language, and a link to the css style sheet. I resolved these issues and properly linked to the stylesheet.</li>
            <li>Lines 13-16 contained a body that was closed before the body content started. The html was also closed before the body content. These were stray tags that were deleted. Now the body opening tag is placed before the body content and both the body and html closing are at the bottom of the page, respectively.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Page 4 Changes</h4>
